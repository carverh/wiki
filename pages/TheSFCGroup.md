**The SFC Group** is a [ComputerClan](?ComputerClan) knockoff ran by a boy named Sage. It is partnered with [Aclevo](?Aclevo).

## Sage
Sage is known to have a very big ego as shown by him thinking he is above or at the same level of quality as the [ComputerClan](?ComputerClan).
The content Sage makes is more like a poorly made budget version of ComputerClan's content than anything original. He also has a weird facination with [Trains](?Trains).
