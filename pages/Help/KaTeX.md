To example $KaTeX$ formatting put `$` around a \KaTeX statement. To make the $KaTeX$ display as a block, use `$$`.

## Examples
### Inline
```tex
The equation to find the slope is $m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.
```

The equation to find the slope is $m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.

### Block.
```tex
The equation to find the slope is $$m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
```

The equation to find the slope is
$$m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
