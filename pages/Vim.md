**Vim (Vi IMproved)** is a improved version of the Vi text editor. Contrary to popular belief, Vi and Vim was one of the only modal editors in existance until recently with the rise of the [VimHipster](?VimHipster). Most other editors didn't have mode switching when Vi came out for the [PDP11](?PDP11) in 1976.

## Basic Vim Keybindings

## Jokes
- A [PsudoNumberGenerator](?PsudoNumberGenerator) could be made by putting computer [Newbies](?Newbies) infront of Vi and asking them to close Vim.
- I use Vim to edit my [Vimrc](?Vimrc) and thats it.
