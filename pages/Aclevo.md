**Aclevo** is a ""content creation""" organization where I "worked" at. It is run by [ReasonablySelenium](?ReasonablySelenium).

## Drama
Aclevo is known for being involved in a lot of drama.

### May 2016 - TTSC Drama
In May 2016, Aclevo was involved in a plot to remove [Thunderbirds101](?Thunderbirds101) and [DuckyDucklet](?DuckyDucklet) from power on the [TTSC](?TTSC) Wiki and Discord via hacking.
Aclevo most likely was using [Nkrs200](?Nkrs200) to accomplish this by either getting Ducky's password or getting Ducky to promote him to Administrator on the Forums and Discord.
This is especially evil on both Nkrs200 and Aclevo's part because Nkrs200 was dating Ducky at the time.
The co-conspirator in this plot promised ReasonablySelenium to help him deal with Marin aka [OpenBooks](?OpenBooks).
Aclevo couldn't get access to the passwords because they aren't 1337 h4x0rs (obviously) and instead started to [Raid](?Raid) the TTSC.
Ducky then made a [DeviantArt](?DeviantArt) post about this which is available [here](http://archive.is/aV0wb).
